About Maze Engine: To get a better understanding about the mentalities and processes of engine development, I set out with the task to craft a simple one. The engine is set up with the primary focus on 2D maze based games. Majority of development on part of the user has been simplified to the manipulation of an XML file. This XML file tells the engine the map layout, player and end goal locations, size, shape, texture identifier, and collision of all simple gameobjects, enemy movement and direction, and trigger functionality. Any extra manipulation on the part of the user can be done to the code files themselves, in areas that have been set up to be as clear as I can make them.
